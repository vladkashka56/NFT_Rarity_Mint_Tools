    content: `xFlipper saves you the time, stress, and guesswork when sniping NFTs. As soon as a collection is revealed, our highly distributed network of ~1k servers scrape the metadata of the NFT collection, and gives you the rarity ranking within seconds. We understand how critical time is when sniping NFT’s, and this is why we bring you the data before anyone else gets it.`,

  {
    title: 'How does xFlipper calculate rarity?',
    content: `We use Rarity Score, which uses weightings and the Combined trait of "Trait Count". Our calculated rarity rank correlates with most known non-live rarity calculators, like Rarity Tools and Nifty River. Rarity is a very subjective metric and even though it’s important when evaluating NFT’s price, it is not the only factor you should consider. Some NFTs might have unique aesthetics and some NFTs might have unique trait combinations that can majorly affect NFT price. So don’t use the rarity as the only determining factor.`,

    title: 'Is there any limit to how many collections I can scrape per day?',
    content: `Every day you can initiate up to 5 “new scrapes”. When scrape is considered a new one? Well... if we don’t have it in our DB and have to fetch all the data from the blockchain, then it’s a new scrape. But if you are looking for a collection that was already scrapped, there is no limit. Scrapped data from our DB contains images, rarities and traits, however OpenSea prices and auctions are always live and up to date.`,
